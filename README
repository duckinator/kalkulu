Kalkulu is a processor design made by Nick Markwell (duckinator).

I had design help from Martin Brandenburg (sdkmvx), Scott Olson (scott) and a few other people on irc.ninthbit.net for earlier versions.

Schematics are created using logisim, which is available at http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/

The design is fully custom.
