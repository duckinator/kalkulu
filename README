Kalkulu is a processor design made by Nick Markwell (duckinator) with the help
of Martin Brandenburg (sdkmvx), Scott Olson (scott) and a few other people on
irc.ninthbit.net.

Schematics are created using Qucs on ArchLinux, I can't promise you'll be able to
view them properly elsewhere.

The design is fully custom.
