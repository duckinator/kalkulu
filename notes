<duckinator> basically, you store in some sort of memory the commands you want
<duckinator> (obviously)
<sdkmvx> but where is the flow control
<duckinator> hang on hang on
<duckinator> and, unless you use jmp, it goes through the commands one after another, 12 bits at a time
<duckinator> it just does that, there's no branching or anything
<duckinator> sdkmvx: think brainfuck, change the loops to jmps and memory locations to registers
<duckinator> (basically)
<sdkmvx> yeah I guess
<duckinator> i think it could actually be actually used as a real computer, even if it runs at the speed of a turtle on it's back
<sdkmvx> wouldn't be fast, but that's not what we're going for
