# Tuna Architecture

Tuna is a computer architecture designed by [Ellen
Dash](https://puppy.technology). It is designed with the end goal of
implementing a system using mostly or exclusively TTL chips and, as
such, aims to be simple to implement.

Work on the architecture began in August 2010. It went through rapid
development until mid-2011, when it was largely abandoned due to lack of
knowledge about architecture design. After (part of an) online course
and various research, work began again in September 2016.

The document defining the architecture is [tuna.md](tuna.md).
